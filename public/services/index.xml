      <description>Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) is a proactive, five-stage framework designed to minimize exposure to cyber attacks. It helps organizations identify and assess vulnerabilities, map potential attack paths, prioritize risks, and track remediation efforts.&#xA;We start by understanding your current security measures and identifying potential vulnerabilities. This approach combines offensive and defensive strategies (Purple teaming), enabling us to identify and mitigate threats more effectively. By integrating our expertise with your teamâ€™s insights, we create a comprehensive defense strategy that is both proactive and adaptive.</description>
