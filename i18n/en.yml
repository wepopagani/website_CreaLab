  translation: What is Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM)?
- id: answer_ctem
  translation: Continuous Threat Exposure Management (CTEM) is a proactive cybersecurity framework designed to continuously assess, prioritize, and mitigate cyber threats. Unlike traditional penetration testing, which provides a snapshot of your security posture at a single point in time, CTEM offers an ongoing, real-time approach to identifying vulnerabilities, managing exposures, and strengthening your security defenses.
- id: question_ctem_vs_pen_testing
  translation: Why should I choose CTEM over standard penetration testing?
- id: answer_ctem_vs_pen_testing
  translation: CTEM provides several advantages over standard penetration testing, including
- id: txt1
  translation: Continuous monitoring allows you to stay ahead of emerging threats and adapt quickly to new vulnerabilities.
- id: txt2
  translation: Prioritized Remediation CTEM helps you focus on the most critical threats first, optimizing your resources and minimizing risk.
- id: txt3
  translation: Unlike point-in-time tests, CTEM covers your entire security landscape, ensuring no gaps are left unaddressed.
- id: question_ctem_integration
  translation: How does CTEM integrate with my existing security infrastructure?
- id: answer_ctem_integration
  translation: CTEM is designed to seamlessly integrate with your existing security tools and processes. It enhances your current defenses by providing continuous visibility into potential threats and exposures. The framework is flexible and can be customized to align with your organization's specific needs, ensuring that it complements rather than disrupts your existing security efforts.
- id: question_employee_awareness
  translation: What is employee awareness training, and why is it crucial for my organization?
- id: answer_employee_awareness
  translation: Employee awareness training is an educational program designed to inform and educate employees about cybersecurity best practices, policies, and procedures. It is crucial for your organization because human error and negligence are significant contributors to cybersecurity breaches. By educating your employees about potential threats, phishing attacks, password hygiene, and safe browsing practices, you empower them to recognize and mitigate security risks, ultimately strengthening your organization's overall security posture.
- id: question_browserfence_vs_edr
  translation: Why should I also consider BrowserFence if I already have an EDR solution?
- id: answer_browserfence_vs_edr
  translation: A Browser Defense and Response (BDR) solution complements an Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) system by focusing specifically on protecting and monitoring web browsers. It enhances security by providing specialized defense against browser-based threats, such as malicious websites, phishing attacks, and HTML smuggling, which may not be adequately addressed by traditional EDR solutions focused on endpoint activities beyond browsers.
- id: question_browserfence_vs_network_devices
  translation: What advantages does it give me compared to the protections provided by network devices?
- id: answer_browserfence_vs_network_devices
  translation: Network devices, while providing certain protections like DNS filtering, limit themselves to analyzing macro data such as domain and its reputation. BrowserFence analyzes page content, shared resources, and DOM modifications in real time, minimizing installation complexity compared to devices.
- id: question_browserfence_suitability
  translation: Is BrowserFence suitable for small or large businesses?
- id: answer_browserfence_suitability
  translation: BrowserFence is suitable for both small and large businesses. For small businesses, it offers ease of deployment with no complex installation or network configuration required, while still providing access to AI support for enhanced security measures. Larger businesses can benefit from BrowserFence's Enterprise plan, which provides scalable features and robust security solutions tailored to meet enterprise-level needs.
